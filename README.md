# aujlar1-Ravneet-Aujla-fall-2021-clone-project

I am Ravneet Aujla. I am pursuing under graduation. My major is computer engineering. Five 
years ago, I moved from India. I did one and half year in computer science engineering over there. 
I learnt C, C++, basics of data structure. I did associate degree and major in engineering science 
from Dutchess community college. I did C++ again. In New Paltz, I did CPS210 (Comp Sci 1 
Foundations), CPS310 (Comp Sci 2 Data Struct), CPS425 (Language Processing), CPS415 
(Discrete & Cont Algorithms) and in this semester, I have CPS353 (Software Engineering) and 
CPS493 (Web Programming). 


I learnt many languages and practice all of codes. I did two projects related to the coding. I did 
traffic light controller in EGC331(Microcontroller System Design). I designed, coded and built the 
project. And this was the one of my best project. I coded in C++. Another project was an elevator 
controller, and I did in EGC320 (Digital System Design). I coded in Verilog. In this project, I 
coded and implemented on FPGA board. 
In this course, I love to learn HTML. I know little about this language. And I also made a web 
page about forest. In this course, I have to use creativity skills to make the web sites. Because it is 
not about just making the sites but also about making beautiful, eye pleasing, and also making it 
user friendly.
